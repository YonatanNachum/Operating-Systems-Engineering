=== This template file contains questions you need to answer.
=== Fill your answers on appropriate blank lines only.
=== Don't start any line with three equal signs "===".
=== Don't edit any lines starting from three equal signs.
=== Use C notation to write numbers: 42 for decimal, 0x2a for hexadecimal.
=== We may check most of the answers automatically, so "forty two" or
=== "26+16" won't work for this example. Spaces are mostly ignored, so
=== "  42  " is OK (without quotes of course). 
=== When asked to specify address & instruction, do it in the form of
=== gdb output "ADDRESS: INSTRUCTION", for example "0x7c26:  or  $0x1,%eax"
=== Don't make lines longer than 80 characters. You don't need to fit your
=== answer in a single line, you can start a new line at will.


=== Q What is the number of the first port BIOS writes into?
0x70

=== Q What is the number of the first port BIOS reads from?
0x71

=== Q What device is probably accessed through above ports?
The CMOS and RTC registers. "CMOS" is a tiny bit of very low
power static memory that lives on the same chip as the Real-Time
Clock (RTC).

0x7c2d: ljmp    $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg
0x7c2d:	ea 32 7c 08 00 66 b8 	ljmp   $0xb866,$0x87c32

===   (remove leading "====" from the correct answer line)
==== hard coded in boot loader
elf header
==== elf tail
==== gnome header
==== gnome tail
==== none of above

===   whole kernel? (not full function declaration, just the name)
bootmain

=== Q What are 4 words of memory at 0x100000 at the point the BIOS
===   enters the boot loader?
===   (as displayed by gdb, in the form WORD1 WORD2 WORD3 WORD4)
0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000

=== Q What are 4 words of memory at 0x100000 at the point the boot
===   loader enters the kernel?
===   (as displayed by gdb, in the form WORD1 WORD2 WORD3 WORD4)
0x1badb002      0x00000000      0xe4524ffe      0x7205c766

=== Q What's the link address of .text section of the kernel?
0xf0100000

=== Q What's the entry point (start address) of the kernel?
0x0010000c

=== Q What source file contains the first kernel instruction?
===   (file name including extensions, but excluding the path)
entry.S

=== Q Study the file you've just found.
===   What's the name of a kernel entry point as appears in this file?
_start

=== Q What line among all kernel sources declares the name you've just
===   found as kernel entry point? (full line)
_start = RELOC(entry)
Line 40 in entry.S

=== Q What's the first instruction which would "break" if you were to
===   get the boot loader's link address wrong? "Break" here means: 
===   the result of executing the instruction is different from the
===   one before the change of the link address.
===   Check yourself by recompiling & debugging!
===   (address & instruction)
0x7c2d: ljmp    $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg
0x7c2d:	ea 36 7c 08 00 66 b8 	ljmp   $0xb866,$0x87c36
We changed link address to 0x7c01:
0x7c31: ljmp    $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg
0x7c31:	ea 36 7c 08 00 66 b8 	ljmp   $0xb866,$0x87c36

=== Q What's the first instruction after the kernel establishes a new
===   mapping that would fail to work properly if the mappings were
===   not in place? (address & instruction)
0x10002d:        jmp    *%eax

=== Q What functions from console.c are directly used by printf.c?
===   (just function names separated by spaces, not full declarations)
cputchar

=== Q What is the task of console.c lines 194-202?
===   (free form, up to 10 words)
When console is full, creates free new line in top of the console.

===   Consider the code
===   	int x = 1, y = 3, z = 4;
===	cprintf("x %d, y %x, z %d\n", x, y, z);
===   executing inside cprintf function just after fmt and ap are
===   initialized (just before the call to vcprintf).

=== Q What's the contents of the first byte in memory pointed to by
===   fmt? (write this byte as a number)
'x' = 120, the first letter in the string.

=== Q What's the contents of the first byte in memory pointed to by
===   ap? (write this byte as a number)
1 - the value of x.

===   Consider the code
===     unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
===     cprintf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);

=== Q What is the output of the code?
He110 World

=== Q To lead to the same output in big-endian architecture, what
===   should be the value of the second argument?
The value needs to stay the same - 57616.
 
=== Q To lead to the same output in big-endian architecture, what
===   should be the value of i?
0x726c6400

=== Q What is printed after "y=" for cprintf("x=%d y=%d", 3)?
===   (free form, up to 10 words)
According to the spec when va_arg is called with no more arguments
in ap, the behavior is undefined.
It will take the content of the 4 bytes after 3 in the stack.

=== Q What instruction reserves space for kernel stack?
===   (address & instruction)
0xf0100034:	bc 00 00 11 f0       	mov    $0xf0110000,%esp

=== Q How many 32-bit words (i.e. bytes/4) does each recursive nesting
===   level of test_backtrace adds to the stack size?
8 including the return address of each call.
After call saves return address on stack.
It pushes %ebp and %ebx.
Increase the stack with 20 bytes.
In summary: 4+4+4+20=32 bytes -> 8 words.
