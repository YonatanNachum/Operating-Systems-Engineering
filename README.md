# CS236376: Operating Systems Engineering

Faculty of Computer Science, Technion.

## Introduction
We implemented, from scratch, a minimalistic yet fully functional operating system that supports virtual memory, kernel and user modes, system calls, threads, context switches, interrupts, interprocess communication, coordination of concurrent activities, file system I/O, and networking.
